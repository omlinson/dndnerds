You wake up in a jail with no idea why you were there. After failing to escape using violence, your captors identified themselves as no other than Santa Claus & his Christmas Elves. You were on the naugthy list but Santa Claus wants to cut you a deal. You aren’t sure what to expect. In any case, he’s given you some more of your stuff back and has invited you to a private meal in a few minutes.
