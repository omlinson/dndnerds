Santa noticed there was no more alcohol for the meal. Schmelfo the alcohol elf was missing! Only Bob wanted to help look for the missing elf in the basement, but Santa managed to convince you to follow.

In the wine cellar, you found Schmelfo surrounded by giant rats.

Jerome set the elf on fire by mistake. Schmelfo was definitely dead now. Bob shot himself in the foot. Thunder killed a rat and injured another. Seymore played it safe. Bob drowned a rat with alcohol.

Thunder & Seymore requested reinforcements from Santa.

What!? Jerome played with a dead rat. He believes itâ€™s skin allows him to cast Minor Illusions.

More rats appeared from a hole at the back of the room.

What!? Bob started a fire.

Jerome failed to be useful. Thunder killed some rats. Seymore broke a nail, but seduced a rat. It has started to fight for your cause!? Seymore turns on the wine sprinklers. The fire spreads.. Thunder gets bored of killing rats, starts trying to stop the fire. Bob makes the fire worse. Seymore fills the room with thick fog. It became impossible to see.

Jerome fell unconscious. The remaining rats played with his unconscious body. He caught a rat STD.

We discovered that Bob is more than 4 times the weight of your average Gnome when he saved Jerome from certain death.

Reinforcements arrive.
